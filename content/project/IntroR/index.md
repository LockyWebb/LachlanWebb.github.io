A colleague and I developed a series of R wrokshops in 2019 that ranged from the basics, to methods for data cleaning, to basic statistical analysis, writing functions, data wrangling, and plotting with ggplot2. I, along with others, have presented those workshops a number of times, to clinician and medical researchers. 

During the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns, I recorded a series of youtube videos of the content (see link). 

The code used for the companion material for the workshops is available at the github link.
