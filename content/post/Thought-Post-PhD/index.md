## I submitted my thesis

I submitted my thesis titled  *Modelling Infant Sleep Brain Activity* on the 29th of November. I started the month with the plan to submit by the 30/11, so I was honestly surprised that I was ready to submit a day earlier.

It was a long slog from starting in January 2020, with impacts from COVID-19 lockdowns and other distractions. Now, while I wait for the thesis to be sent to examiners, and then my oral defense in 2024, I am happy to be starting a post-doc in the new year. 

## New things to come

I will join the Clinical Brain Networks group at QIMR Berghofer, initally as a reasearch assistant while I wait for my thesis to be assessed, then as a post-doctoral researcher. 

I currently plan to continue working in the QIMR B Statistics Unit part time.

Also, the three planned papers from thesis are yet to be published. One had been submitted, and the other two are in the works, so I am sure I will be kept busy next year. 

I am looking forward to new challenges and a bit of a different scene in 2024.
